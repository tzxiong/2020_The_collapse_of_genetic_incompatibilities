The code depository for the manuscript "The collapse of genetic incompatibilities in a hybridizing population"

All simulations are performed using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) v1.5 and its package [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v6.16/)
Simulating a discrete jump process can be achieved using the recipes here ([Discrete Stochastic (Gillespie) Equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v6.16/tutorials/discrete_stochastic_example/)).
