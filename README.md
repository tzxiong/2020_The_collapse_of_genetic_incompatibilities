Code repository for the manuscript "The collapse of genetic incompatibilities in hybridizing populations"

Simulation of the birth-death model was performed with [Julia](https://julialang.org/) v1.5 and its package [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v6.16/)

Simulating a discrete jump process can be achieved using the recipes here ([Discrete Stochastic (Gillespie) Equations](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v6.16/tutorials/discrete_stochastic_example/)).

Simulation of spatial systems were performed in [SLiM-3.6](https://messerlab.org/slim/)
